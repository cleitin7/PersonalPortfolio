Build a fully custom portfolio website from scratch in the exact visual style of cohesion.framer.ai, but with all the personalized features, fixes and upgrades described below. Do not import any template—construct every section fresh according to these rules.

1. Hero Section
Profile photo centered:

In a rounded container with subtle shadow.

Main headline: “Hi, I’m Cleitin!”

Subtitle: “Full-Stack Developer & AI Specialist”

Call-to-action button: “Let’s Work Together!”

On hover/click, the button should expand right and reveal a 📞 emoji with smooth animation.

Trust badge: “80+ Happy Clients”

Floating decorative PNGs:

→ Multiply, mirror, rotate and scatter multiple instances of these two icons around the hero, with a very gentle up-and-down floating animation.

2. About Me (Layered Scroll Animation)
Break into 4 parts, each with its own scroll-triggered slide-in-from-bottom that overlays the previous text. Style with:

Alternating light background highlights or soft color bars

Bold headings for each part

Ample spacing, shadows and smooth fade/slide transitions

Text parts (example):

“Hey! I’m Cleitin, a Full-Stack developer…”

“With deep expertise in CSS & C++…”

“I create prompt engineering systems for AI…”

“My mission is to deliver high-impact digital solutions…”

3. Client Testimonials (Carousel)
Horizontal carousel with smooth auto/manual scroll

Each slide: circular avatar + name + role + quote

Avatars & data:

Lucas Vieira (CTO, PixelForge) — “Cleitin went above and beyond…”

Aline Moraes (CEO, BrightClick) — “The AI strategies he built saved us…”

Rafael Duarte (Head of Product, NovaNext) — “Fast, clean code with style…”

Add soft fade-in or slide-in animation for each testimonial

4. My Stack (Flip-Cards)
For each of these 4 items, create a two-sided flip-card:

Front: official logo/icon (C++, CSS, ChatGPT, Full-Stack Dev)

Back: short description of your expertise

Smooth 3D flip animation

Styled shadows and background

5. Services (What I Offer)
