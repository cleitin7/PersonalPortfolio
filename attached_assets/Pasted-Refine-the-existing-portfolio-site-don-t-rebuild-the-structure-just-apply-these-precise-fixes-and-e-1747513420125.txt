Refine the existing portfolio site—don’t rebuild the structure, just apply these precise fixes and enhancements:

1. Hero & Floating Icons
Fix hover bug: Ensure the “Let’s Work Together!” button hover/animation never interrupts the floating icons.

WhatsApp CTA: On click, open https://wa.link/xq9r4b immediately.

Intuitiveness (Desktop): Increase button hit-area, add a slight hover glow, and ensure it’s keyboard-focusable.

Floating Decorative Elements:

Multiply, mirror, rotate, and scatter multiple instances of:

All should have a very gentle independent floating animation (up/down) that never stutters.

2. About Me Section
Ensure visibility: Rebuild so all 3–4 parts slide in from below on scroll.

Desktop Intuition: Pin part headers to the top as the user scrolls through each “chapter.”

Visual polish: Alternate between light and dark neutral backgrounds, with smooth fade/slide transitions.

3. Client Testimonials (Carousel)
Smooth horizontal auto/manual scroll with fade-in.

Add a soft backdrop (light/dark neutral overlay) behind each slide.

4. My Stack (Flip-Cards)
Front: Tech logo/icon (C++, CSS, ChatGPT, Full-Stack)

Back: Short description

Smooth 3D flip on hover/click, with slight shadow.

Alternate card backgrounds between light/dark neutral tones.

5. Services Section (What I Offer)
Left: animated semi-transparent numbers (01/02/03) with pulsing hover effect.

Right: descriptive text.

Remove any UX mention.

Alternate each block’s background between light and dark neutral.

6. Replace Pricing with CTAs
Remove all pricing cards.

CTA #1: “Falar no WhatsApp” → https://wa.link/xq9r4b

CTA #2: “Ver meus projetos no GitHub” → https://github.com/cleitin7

Both buttons: hover expansion + glow.

7. “Marcar uma call” Buttons
Replace all “Book a Call” texts with “Marcar uma call”.

On hover/click expand right and reveal 📞 emoji with a bounce-in.

8. Global Visual & Interaction Enhancements
Neutral palette: alternating bands of whites, greys, charcoals.

Smooth scroll-based transitions & fade-ins.

Hover effects on buttons, cards, images.

Ensure full responsiveness and keyboard navigation support.
